Created almost entirely by AI, so I take no responsibility for the code quality 🐸

## How to run
Once before running the app, you need to install the dependencies and build the project. After that, you can run the app without building it again.
```bash
npm i              # install dependencies
npm run build      # build the project
```

After the build is complete, you can run the app.
```bash
npm start          # start the app after building
```

You may also start the app in development mode by running the Vite server and Electron separately.
```bash
npm run dev:vite   # start Vite server with React app
npm run dev        # launch Electron in another terminal to serve the React app
```

To pack the app and get an .exe file, you can use the following command. The output will be in the `dist` folder.
```bash
npm run pack       # pack the app into an executable
```
